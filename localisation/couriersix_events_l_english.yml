 nf_couriersix.1.d:0 "Finally, after all these years, the Platinum Chip was found by my hired scavengers in Sunnyvale. In order for it to reach Vegas without delay, I will contract the Mojave Express to deliver multiple packages with multiple couriers to Vegas, with only one carrying the Platinum Chip. The rest will carry dummy packages to throw off any wasteland miscreants. I will assign Victor the securitron to place the orders at the Mojave Express office in Primm and ensure the courier with my chip arrives saftely."
 nf_couriersix.1.a:0 "It's only a matter of time."
 
 nf_couriersix.2.t:0 "Ain't That a Kick in the Head"
 nf_couriersix.2.d:0 "The Courier carrying the Platinum Chip, Courier Six, was ambushed and shot in the head in Goodsprings by a third party. But miraculously, Victor dug the Courier out of his own grave that very same night and brought him to Doc Mitchell, where he shortly recovered!"
 nf_couriersix.2.a:0 "I didn't account for this variable..."
 
 nf_couriersix.3.t:0 "They Went That-a-Way"
 nf_couriersix.3.d:0 "Apparently The Courier has amnesia, no doubt a result of his injury, and is making his way through the Mojave in pursuit of his killer. Along the way, he discovered the man who has the package is located somewhere in Vegas. Luckily for me, that's exactly where I need him. Unfortunately Victor could not make out who shot him, but I will make sure he nudges The Courier in the right direction."

 nf_couriersix.5.d:0 "After killing the murderer in front of everyone, the leader of The Tops casino invited The Courier to his room upstairs. There, he introduced The Courier to Yes Man, a securitron reprogrammed to always be agreeable. He details an entire plan to overthrow Mr House by uploading Yes Man's neuro-computational matrix on the Lucky 38's mainframe, and also mentions a meeting with the Strip's Three Families to discuss the future of Vegas."
 nf_couriersix.5.a:0 "I'll attend that meeting."
 
 nf_couriersix.6.t:0 "Beware the Wrath of Caesar!"
 nf_couriersix.6.d:0 "Shortly after exiting The Tops, The Courier was contacted by Vulpes Inculta of the Legion. Vulpes graced The Courier with an invitation for an audience with Caesar, who was astonished by his resolve. First, however; Caesar requires Mr. House out of the picture. Vulpes discloses to The Courier a plan to put The Courier in power of Vegas, where he and a team of Frumentarii agents will storm the Lucky 38 and set it ablaze."

The topic of discussion was what to do about the NCR and Legion, and if Vegas should support either or rise up against them. The Courier spoke and convinced them to go through with his own plan. The Courier ordered the Three Families to mobilize and take the Lucky 38 by force. Once Mr House was eliminated, the Three Families would establish an oligarchy with the Courier as leader.

 nf_couriersix.13.d:0 "The Courier's unrivaled grasp on Vegas couldn't last forever.
